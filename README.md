# Course-Recommender

Welcome to Course-Recommender, a project developed as part of the Introduction to Data Science course. This innovative endeavor harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 Language Model (LLM) to build a sophisticated search engine tailored for courses at the University of Tartu. Our journey through the realm of data science has led us to explore, train, and evaluate the model to enhance the course discovery experience.

## Goals

1. **Explore GPT-4 LLM**: Embark on a journey into the intricacies of OpenAI's GPT-4 Language Model. We delve into its advanced natural language processing capabilities to create an enriched course search experience.

2. **Train on University of Tartu Data**: Utilize the vast dataset of University of Tartu courses to fine-tune GPT-4 LLM. This step ensures that the model is finely attuned to the specific nuances and requirements of the academic offerings at the University.

3. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Rigorously assess the trained model's performance and the relevance of its responses. This involves testing its ability to recommend courses accurately based on user queries and contextual information.

## Datasets

- **[Courses.json](data/Courses_FULL.json) (18,3MB):** This dataset contains information on all courses available in University of Tartu, including details on the study program to which each course is listed and the prerequisite courses.
- **[Embeddings.json](data/embeddings.json) (165.5MB):** Dataset with text-embeddings for all courses
